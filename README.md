# Excel-QHSE-Performance-Dashboard
## Project Title: Unifying Metrics for Smarter Decision-Making
This GitHub project encapsulates not just a technical achievement but a testament to my ability to tackle real-world data challenges and deliver impactful solutions

## Project Overview
In the dynamic landscape of data analytics, I, Mujeeb adeyanju SUNMOLA, an automotive part analyst, found myself in a compelling challenge that not only tested my analytical skills but also underscored the power of collaboration in problem-solving. This journey began when my senior colleague, the HSE manager, approached me with a complex data visualization dilemma, seeking to consolidate diverse metrics across 11 business units. This GitHub project narrates my approach, challenges, and triumphs in turning this problem into a real-life data analytics project. Embark on a journey with me as I tackle a complex data analytics challenge presented by the Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) Manage

## Problem Statement:
The task at hand involved synchronizing disparate KPI datasets for each of our 11 business units and creating an automated real-time performance dashboard. The challenge was not only technical but required a deep understanding of the intricacies of Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) metrics. My mission was to harmonize data from 48 different Excel sheets representing various aspects of our operations and deliver a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard that facilitates informed decision-making.


## Data:
The initial dataset consisted of 48 Excel sheets, each representing a specific aspect of QHSE metrics across different business units. These sheets ranges from vital categories like Document Control to Safety Activity Plans, Lagging Indicators, Leading Indicators, and various KPIs and Dashboards for distinct business units.
# QHSE Performance Visualization Dashboard

## Introduction

This project revolves around a real-world challenge presented by the QHSE Manager, where I was tasked with synchronizing and automating performance metrics for 11 business units into a single dashboard. As an Automotive Part Analyst, my expertise in advanced Excel tools and data analysis played a crucial role in addressing this challenge.

## Problem Statement

The QHSE Manager needed a real-time performance visualization dashboard to display metrics and their respective performances for each business unit. The data was scattered across 48 different Excel sheets, making it challenging to create a cohesive and insightful dashboard.

## Data
The initial data comprised 48 Excel sheets, each representing different metrics for 11 business units. Some of the key sheets included Document Control, Safety Activity Plan, Lagging Indicators, Leading Indicators, and various Quality KPIs.

## My Approach:
### 1. The Ask Phase:  This phase laid the foundation for clear project goals.
- Engaged in thorough discussions with the QHSE manager to understand objectives and expectations
- Clarified professional jargon to sought clarity on complex metrics
  
### 2. The Prepare Phase
- Scrutinized the complex initial data
- Visualized the report's structure, creating mental charts to decipher the intricate web of information

### The Process Phase
- Employed a combination of conditional formatting, data validation, VLOOKUP, and text formatting to to clean and format the messy data.
- Conducted iterative discussions with the QHSE Manager to refine the initial report.
- Harmize data from different sources into a single, well-organized coherent table.

### The Analyze & Viz Phase
- Defined clear pivot tables to organize and create summary for each performance metric
- Generated insightful charts for visualizing key insights from each performance metric
- Utilized the Slicer tool to develop an interactive performance dashboard, ensuring real-time synchronization with any changes in the underlying data.

### The Share Phase
- Collaborated with a colleague for feedback during the visualization stage.
- Incorporated insights, made necessary changes, and presented the final solution to the QHSE Manager.

## Tools Used:
- Applied a suite of advanced Excel tools, including Pivot tables, Slicer tools, VLOOKUP, and conditional formatting.
- Demonstrated collaboration, networking, and researching skills through extensive discussions, learning, and reviews.

## Results:
A video demonstration showcasing the cleaned synchronized data table and an interactive performance dashboard, providing a tangible representation of the project's success.
