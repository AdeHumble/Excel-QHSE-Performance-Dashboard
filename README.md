## PROJECT OVERVIEW
In the dynamic landscape of data analytics, I, Mujeeb adeyanju SUNMOLA, an automotive part analyst, found myself in a compelling challenge that not only tested my analytical skills but also underscored the power of collaboration in problem-solving.


This journey began when my senior colleague, the HSE manager, approached me with a complex data visualization dilemma, seeking to consolidate diverse metrics across 11 business units. This GitHub project narrates my approach, challenges, and triumphs in turning this problem into a real-life data analytics project.
  

Embark on a journey with me as I tackle a complex data analytics challenge presented by the Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) Manage

  
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The task at hand involved synchronizing disparate KPI datasets for each of our 11 business units and creating an automated real-time performance dashboard.

The challenge was not only technical but required a deep understanding of the intricacies of Quality, Health, Safety, and Environment (QHSE) metrics.

**My mission was to harmonize data from 48 different Excel sheets representing various aspects of our operations and deliver a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard that facilitates informed decision-making.**

## DATA
The initial dataset consisted of 48 Excel sheets, each representing a specific aspect of QHSE metrics across different business units.

These sheets ranges from vital categories like Document Control to Safety Activity Plans, Lagging Indicators, Leading Indicators, and various KPIs and Dashboards for distinct business units.

## MY APPROACH
#### 1. The Ask Phase
- Engaged in thorough discussions with the QHSE manager to understand objectives and expectations
- Clarified professional jargon to sought clarity on complex metrics
  
#### 2. The Prepare Phase
- Scrutinized the complex initial data
- Visualized the report's structure, creating mental charts to decipher the intricate web of information

#### 3. The Process Phase
- Employed a combination of conditional formatting, data validation, VLOOKUP, and text formatting to to clean and format the messy data.
- Conducted iterative discussions with the QHSE Manager to refine the initial report.
- Harmize data from different sources into a single, well-organized coherent table.

#### 4. The Analyze & Viz Phase
- Defined clear pivot tables to organize and create summary for each performance metric
- Generated insightful charts for visualizing key insights from each performance metric
- Utilized the Slicer tool to develop an interactive performance dashboard, ensuring real-time synchronization with any changes in the underlying data.

#### 5. The Share Phase
- Collaborated with a colleague for feedback during the visualization stage.
- Incorporated insights, made necessary changes, and presented the final solution to the QHSE Manager.

## TOOLS USED
- Applied a suite of advanced Excel tools, including Pivot tables, Slicer tools, VLOOKUP, and conditional formatting.
- Demonstrated collaboration, networking, and researching skills through extensive discussions, learning, and reviews.

## RESULTS
A video demonstration showcasing the cleaned synchronized data table and an interactive performance dashboard, providing a tangible representation of the project's success.

## SKILLS ACCRUED
#### 1. Analytical Approach
Developed a structured analytical approach to understanding complex challenges, breaking them into manageable phases, and delivering effective solutions.

#### 2. Collaboration, Effective Communication and Networking
Demonstrated the power of collaboration by engaging in detailed discussions, seeking insights from colleagues, and incorporating feedback for continuous improvement.

#### 3. Problem-Solving
Navigated through intricate data structures, solved problems iteratively, and applied creative solutions to synchronize and visualize diverse datasets.

#### 4. Data Analysis
- Applied a range of data analysis techniques, including conditional formatting, data validation, and visualization tools, to derive meaningful insights from raw data.
- Proficiency in using advanced Excel tools for data synchronization and visualization.
